Directory structure: This structure is following the parsec for gem5.

parsec-2.1 
    |_________ bin
    |_________ include
    |_________ lib
    |_________ inputs
                  |________ blackscholes
                  |________ bodytrack
                  |________ canneal
                  |________ dedup
                  |________ ferret
                  |________ fluidanimate
                  |________ freqmine
                  |________ streamcluster
                  |________ x264

bin
===
Parsec 2.1 applications and kernels are statically built and put in the bin/
directory. Except for freqmine's rtview and vips, they are not successfully
built statically.


include
=======
x264.h header file is placed in include/, which is needed for x264.


lib
===
x264 related library archive and files are placed in lib/.


# Note: no need to chaage or touch bin/ include/ and lib/.


inputs
======
All the inputs of the applications and kernels are put in the input/
directory. You need to download the input tar ball from parsec website:
http://parsec.cs.princeton.edu/download/2.1/parsec-2.1-sim.tar.gz

$ mkdir tmp; cd tmp
$ wget http://parsec.cs.princeton.edu/download/2.1/parsec-2.1-sim.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf parsec-2.1-sim.tar.gz

Then you will get a parsec-2.1/ directory in tmp/. Inside this directories,
the corresponding inputs for each applications are in
pkgs/apps/${appname}/inputs or pkgs/kernels/${kernelname}/inputs. For each
inputs dir, untar small medium and large tarball, and mv the uncompressed
input files to coresponding inputs directory in the above structure.

$ tar xvf input_simsmall.tar

# Node: for dedup, small medium and large tar ball all have the same
# media.data file. Untar them one by one, and rename them to be medias.dat,
# mediam.dat and medial.dat.
